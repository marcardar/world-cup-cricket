  7) The Game - 'World Cup Cricket'

    After entering your name you can choose whether to go straight into the
    'World Cup' or qualify first. Qualifying is a good way to get used to how
    the game plays so that you are well prepared for the World Cup but at the
    same time you run the risk of failing to qualify.

    Soon after you have done this you will be presented with the main menu:

   i)  Main Menu
   
    By pressing any number from 1-7 you will be able to access the option
    You want:
 
     1 - BEGIN TOURNAMENT

       This will put you into one of the following 5 tournaments:
     
   The CARIBBEAN LEAGUE - Four guest nations plus the West Indies battle it
   out on a round robbin basis in the heat of the Caribbean to see who will
   top the league.

   The CURREY CUP - Hosts South Africa and Zimbabwae challenge two other
   teams in a knockout event over 45 overs.

   The FOUNDERS CUP - A series of three matches which pits England against a
   guest nation over 50 overs. The winner being the team which wins the most
   games.  It is played in England.

   The PACIFIC CUP - A tough tournament which pits a guest nation against
   hosts Australia and New Zealand in a league over 40 overs. The top two
   then play off in the final to decide the winners.

   The SHAH CUP - This event features two mini leagues of three teams. Sri
   Lanka, Pakistan and India have home advantage against three guest nations.
   The top two teams of each league contest the semi finals and then the
   final.

   
     2 - SQUAD SELECTION

       First you will be presented with a list of 8 specialist batsmen from
       which you may select 6 to play in the tournament that year. You will
       see that a default 6 players has already been selected and if you wish
       to make no change just press 'C' to continue. There are also default
       selections for the following 3 squad selection teams. The highlighted
       player is shown in a red bar, selected players are shown in white
       foreground and deselected players are shown in yellow foreground. If you
       wish to select or deselect a player, you must first use the cursor keys
       to move the red bar to that player and then press 'S' or 'D'. Once you
       have made your selection, press 'C' to confirm.

       Note: If after pressing 'C', nothing happens, you must check that you
             have selected the right number of players as shown on the screen.
     
       The following screens behave in the same manner.
       by Pressing 'B' at any time during squad selection you can toggle between
       showing the players in order of batting or bowling averages. You cannot
       order the wicket keepers by bowling averages because none of them can
       bowl.

       If you only wish to view your squad then press 'C' to cycle through the
       4 different categories of players.

     3 - VIEW TOURNAMENTS

       The tournament highlighted in white is the tournament that you will be 
       playing in.
       If you are in year 4 you will be presented with all the fixtures in the
       World Cup.

     4 - INTERNATIONAL TABLE

       You are shown in white. Teams are ordered by percentage points where a
       win is worth 2 points and a draw 1 point. Where this is equal the teams
       are ordered by the value of 'number of losses taken away from the number
       of wins' with the higher value being put higher in the table.
     
       If you chose to try to qualify you will find yourself bottom of the table
       and you will have to win your semi-final match in the Currey Cup if you
       are to lift yourself off the bottom of the table and play in the World
       Cup.

     5 - AVERAGES

       These are updated after every match.
     
     6 - INTERNATIONAL STATISTICS

       You will find that where your personal records are shown, there are some
       statistics already there even before you a game. These are the records
       from the matches played in the tournaments after the last World Cup and
       have been put there to give you an idea of the scores you should be
       expecting to achieve. In the registered version all your records are set
       to zero when you begin.

     7 - EXIT

       You will be given save your position as long as you have played at least
       one tournament.

     
  
    Once you have entered the tournament you will be presented with a map of
    the country in which you will be playing, tournament records and a brief
    description of the structure of the tournament. Then you will meet another
    menu.

     1 - Begin next match. (Self explanatory)

     2 - Select team

       A default will already be selected but by using the cursor keys along
       with the other keys as shown on the screen you can change your team. The
       different colours signify what type of role the player will play in the
       match. Selecting a player blue will enable him to bowl - you may only
       bowl a maximum of 6 players and you can only select players as bowlers
       if they have a bowling skill of more than zero. 'Other' players can
       neither bowl nor take wicket - they tend to be specialist batsmen.

       The four qualities - batting, bowling, fitness and form (on a scale of
       zero to twenty) act as a guide to which players should be selected.
       Fitness and form are described in more detail below.

       Fitness - This declines rapidly for bowlers, less so for batsmen. To
       counter this you should make regular alterations to the side enabling the
       players to recouperate. Over-use of players makes them become stale and
       will affect their performance ie a player of 1 (one) fitness is useless.

       Form - This changes from match to match and is an indication of the
       players current form. High values will mean he is very confident and has
       been successful with the bat or ball. A loss in form may result in poor
       performances.



    The rest of the menu is fairly self-explanatory and varies depending on
    which tournament your are in.



  ii) Playing 'World Cup Cricket'

    Pressing '1' in the main menu will take you to the next match.
    The teams are displayed and  the opposition and your teams strengths and
    weaknesses are compared. If your fitness is significantly low the
    likelyhood of catches being dropped, fielder mistakes and a general
    lethargic performance overall are increased. Alterations should be made
    when you next return to the main menu. A coin is tossed and the opposition
    will inform you of its intention to bat or field if it wins, press space
    to continue. If you win use 'b' to bat or 'f' to field.


 iii) If you elect or are put into bat

    Select your two openers. They should be chosen to see off the new ball to
    enable the middle order to slog. Openers are specialist batsmen and by
    looking at player qualities when choosing the team you can see which
    normally do the job. Enter the batsman number and press 'return'.
    Edited Highlights will be displayed.... Make sure your finger is poised
    over The 'r' button. If the ball doesn't cross the boundary as a 4 or 6 it
    will be fielded by the opposition. By pressing 'r' will enable your batsmen
    to run, you must decide if it is safe to do so. Failure to keep the score-
    board ticking over by taking quick runs will reduce the overall team
    score. However, run outs can be equally disasterous. Even if you are
    outside the crease there is still a possibility that the opposition fielder
    will miss the stumps. If a decision is close the umpire will be called
    upon to adjudicate. Unfortunately this is open to human error and may be
    dubious but that's cricket! Along the bottom of the field brief comments
    on the action is displayed.


  iv) If you elect to field or are put into field

    Utilising your bowlers to the optinum performance is an acquired skill.
    With practise you will discover which can conserve runs and which will take
    wickets. When in the scorecard (ie at fall of Wicket or at the end of each
    over) by pressing 'f' you will be able to select from three fields -
    orthodox, defensive, attacking, highly attacking and unorthodox each with
    their own merits. The first 10 overs with the new ball and the last are
    the most critical. Bowlers are restricted to 10 overs none of which can be
    bowled consecutively. If you are unable to select a particular bowler
    or the computer automatically selects someone else this is to enable the
    above rules for bowling to apply. This can be remedied by trying another
    bowler who hasn't completed his spell.

    After your match has finished all the league results that week are shown.
    (including high scores and best bowling figures).


   v) Strategy

    Once you have got to grips with the game you may find that you want to have
    a greater influence on how you play each match. You can do this by using
    the strategy option which enables you to change the risk with which your
    team plays. For example, if you find that you need to increase your run
    rate try increasing the risk in the strategy page.

    The strategy option is available by pressing 'S' when:
    a) A bowler is running up to the wicket
    b) You are selecting a new batsman to go into bat
    c) You are bowling and an over has just been completed.



   There is a history page and a round-up of all the other tournaments for every
   event that England plays in. Each team plays three international one-day
   tournaments and the eight out of the nine with the best % wins qualify for
   The 'World Cup'. If you fail to qualify you are sacked.

   England's career averages and averages since the last 'World Cup' are
   avialable after each tournament.  A career page compares your successes
   with other captains and lists the current holders of each title along with
   your 'best' statistics overall.



  8) Changing the speed

   This game should run at the same speed on any PC. However, if you find the
   game is running too quickly or to slowly try typing the following at the DOS
   prompt when you next run 'World Cup Cricket':

                    WCC X  (Where X is a whole number from 1 to 100)

   As a rough guide, a 286-10 machine should run perfectly if you type

                    WCC 6     to begin the program.

   You may have to play around with finding the best value for your P.C.


  9) Information on changing team and player names

   If you decide that you want to change some of the names you can easily
   change the data files using a text editor. However, if you do this you must
   make sure that you have backed up this program in case anything goes wrong.



  'Sticky Wicket' - Another cricket game written by M.J.Carter

   'Sticky Wicket' is the ultimate county cricket game for the P.C. It
   combines the art of captaincy with week to week action of playing. Your
   objective is to win the league and 'Sticky' cup. Your predecessor has
   left, despondent with the teams poor run of recent results. By selecting
   the team, choosing field placings, who bowls the crucial overs, where
   everyone bats and even when a player must run you aim to return the team
   to its former glory. Your success at doing so will be compared to the
   greats  e.g W.G Grace , M.Brearly in the hall of fame. Hence the term
   'Sticky Wicket' hence the situaton you face where winning is the difference
   between glory AND Failure! It is accompanied with a 2-player game and costs
   just 15 pounds (or œ10 for those who have already registered a game with me).
