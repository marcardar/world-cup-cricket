  1) Intoduction
  --------------
   World Cup Cricket is a shareware DOS cricket game for the PC.

   World Cup Cricket is based on international one-day matches played between
   the nine test playing countries.  You choose a team and guide them through a
   series of international tournaments each with their own unique format. After
   three tournaments you play in the ultimate competition - the World Cup (that
   is assuming you qualify, of course).  The format of the actual matches is
   similar to that of its predecessor Sticky Wicket but with some additional
   features such as umpire images and advanced strategy within the match
   situation.

   World Cup Cricket is the second of two cricket games I have written for the
   PC.  The other is called Sticky Wicket and is based on english county
   one-day matches.

   Remember! -	If you wish to continue playing this game you should register
		with me, the author.


  2) Hardware requirements
  ------------------------
   World Cup Cricket should work on any IBM compatible PC with EGA or better
   graphics card and at least 512K of RAM. This should be ok for any PC less
   than 7 years old!


  3) What should be on this disk
  ------------------------------
   The following 17 files should appear on your disk:
   [main directory]
	Register.frm	- Registration form - Print this when you register
	WCC	.dat	- Main data file
	WCC	.exe	- The executable game
	(WCC	.key)	- Registration key file - registered users only!
	WCC	.txt	- Main documentation
	WCCMatch.dat	- Another data file 
	WCCPart0.bin	- Part of the actual game
	WCCPart1.bin	- Part of the actual game
	WCCTeams.dat	- Data file containing the 9 team names
	["ShareDat\" subdirectory] - Shareware data files
		GameInfo.txt
		Preview	.txt
		UserTeam.da3
		UserTeam.da4
		WCC	.po3
		WCC	.po4
		WCC	.sa3
		WCC	.sa4
	["Teams\" subdirectory] - Team data files
		Australi.dat
		England	.dat
		India	.dat
		NewZeala.dat
		Pakistan.dat
		SouthAfr.dat
		SriLanka.dat
		WestIndi.dat
		Zimbabwe.dat

   When you play the game for the first time, a subdirectory called "WCCSaves\"
   is created and files called "User.sav", "UserTeam.dat", "WCC.pos", "WCC.sav"
   are stored there.  You should ensure that at least 7K of disk space is
   available for these files to be created.


  4) Features
  -----------
   These are the features of the registered version:

   * Database of 225 players, 9 teams each with career statistics and batting
     and bowling abilities
   * User can take charge of ANY one of the 9 teams
   * Seasonal and career averages for your team
   * World Cup averages for all teams involved
   * Qualification period of 3 years where England plays in 3 out of 5
     different events. The "World Cup" is played the following year.
     (For more info on the tournaments, see 7(vi) "The Tournaments")
   * Unlimited number of seasons
   * Edited highlights of the game including action shots, LBWs, run outs etc
   * Match interactivity - when to run, who to bowl, batting order, field
     placings etc
   * Your strategy can be changed throughout the match
   * Comments on the shots played and dismissals
   * Umpire decisions in response to appeals
   * Squad selection - pick a squad of 16 from 25 to take to each tournament
   * Team selection - choose 11 from 16 before each match
   * 5 different built-in field settings
   * Save / restore position after each tournament
   * Career page showing your teams records and comparisons with other teams
   * Choice of five levels of difficulty


  5) Features disabled in shareware version
  -----------------------------------------
   The shareware version has been restricted in the following ways:

   * You cannot choose which team to take charge of - it must be India
   * You can only play in the Currey Cup (if you decide to qualify) and the
     league stage of the World Cup.  You cannot play in the Founders Series,
     Caribbean League, Pacific Challenge or Shah Cup.
   * Once you reach the knockout stage of the World Cup, the shareware version
     shows some registration information and then quits itself.
   * You do not have unlimited seasons
   * Save / restore facility has been disabled

   The shareware version has its own theme where you are taking over the
   struggling Indian side at a mid-season position. This theme does not exist
   in the registered version as you start a whole new career from scratch at
   the beginning of a season.

   This should be enough to give you a taster of the full-blown registered
   version.


  6) Starting up
  --------------
   To start World Cup Cricket, first change to the directory where WCC is
   located and then type "WCC". (Best to run from the DOS prompt).

   You should be greeted by the title page followed by a request to enter your
   name. The rest is slightly different depending on whether you are running
   the registered or shareware version.

   The registered version:
	If you wish to continue from where you left off then do not type
        anything, just press "Enter". This will take you straight to the main
	menu where everything should be exactly as you left it.
	If you wish to start a new career, then enter your name, and then a
	level setting. Then you will be presented with a list of 9 teams and
	you can choose which one to take charge of. Then you will be taken to
	the Main Menu.

   The shareware version:
	Enter your name and then a number (1 to 5) to indicate the level of
	difficulty. If it is your first time then I suggest level 1. You are
	then asked whether you wish to qualify for the World Cup or not. Enter
	"y" if you would like to play in the Currey Cup before you take on the
	mighty World Cup. This is a good idea if you want to get used to the
	controls, but beware - if you lose your first match, then you will be
	sacked! However, even beginners should have little difficulty (in their
	first match in the Currey Cup) beating the lowly Zimbabwe...


  7) The Game - "World Cup Cricket"
  ---------------------------------
   Soon after the title sequence and entering your name, you are presented
   with the main menu...

   i) The Main Menu
   
    By pressing any number from 1-7 you will be able to access the option
    You want:
 
     1 - Begin Tournament

       This takes you into your next tournament.
     
     2 - Squad Selection

       First you will be presented with a list of 8 specialist batsmen from
       which you may select 6 to play in the tournament that year. You will
       see that a default 6 players has already been selected and if you wish
       to make no change just press 'C' to continue. There are also default
       selections for the following 3 squad selection teams. The highlighted
       player is shown in a red bar, selected players are shown in white
       foreground and deselected players are shown in yellow foreground. If you
       wish to select or deselect a player, you must first use the cursor keys
       to move the red bar to that player and then press 'S' or 'D'. Once you
       have made your selection, press 'C' to confirm.

       Note: If after pressing 'C', nothing happens, you must check that you
             have selected the right number of players as shown on the screen.
     
       The following screens behave in the same manner.
       By Pressing 'B' at any time during squad selection you can toggle
       between showing the players in order of batting or bowling averages. You
       cannot order the wicket keepers by bowling averages because none of them
       can bowl.

       If you only wish to view your squad then press 'C' to cycle through the
       4 different categories of players.

     3 - View Tournaments

       The tournament highlighted in white is the tournament that you will be 
       playing in.
       If you are in year 4 you will be presented with all the fixtures in the
       World Cup.

     4 - International Table

       You are shown in white. Teams are ordered by percentage points where a
       win is worth 2 points and a draw 1 point. Where this is equal the teams
       are ordered by the value of 'number of losses taken away from the number
       of wins' with the higher value being put higher in the table.
     
       If you chose to try to qualify you will find yourself bottom of the
       table and you will have to win your semi-final match in the Currey Cup
       if you are to lift yourself off the bottom of the table and play in the
       World Cup.

     5 - Averages

       These are updated after every match.
     
     6 - Career Page

       You will find that where your personal records are shown, there are some
       statistics already there even before you a game. These are the records
       from the matches played in the tournaments after the last World Cup and
       have been put there to give you an idea of the scores you should be
       expecting to achieve. In the registered version all your records are set
       to zero when you begin.

     S - Toggle Sound On/Off

     Q - Quit

       Your position is automatically saved as long as you have played at least
       one tournament.
     
    Once you have entered the tournament you will be presented with a map of
    the country in which you will be playing, tournament records and a brief
    description of the structure of the tournament. Then you will meet another
    menu.

     1 - Begin next match. (Self explanatory)

     2 - Select team

       A default will already be selected but by using the cursor keys along
       with the other keys as shown on the screen you can change your team. The
       different colours signify what type of role the player will play in the
       match. Selecting a player blue will enable him to bowl - you may only
       bowl a maximum of 6 players and you can only select players as bowlers
       if they have a bowling skill of more than zero. 'Other' players can
       neither bowl nor take wicket - they tend to be specialist batsmen.

       The four qualities - batting, bowling, fitness and form (on a scale of
       zero to twenty) act as a guide to which players should be selected.
       Fitness and form are described in more detail below.

       Fitness - This declines rapidly for bowlers, less so for batsmen. To
       counter this you should make regular alterations to the side enabling
       the players to recouperate. Over-use of players makes them become stale
       and will affect their performance ie a player of 1 (one) fitness is
       useless.

       Form - This changes from match to match and is an indication of the
       players current form. High values will mean he is very confident and has
       been successful with the bat or ball. A loss in form may result in poor
       performances.


    The rest of the menu is fairly self-explanatory and varies depending on
    which tournament your are in.

  ii) Playing World Cup Cricket

    Pressing '1' in the main menu will take you to the next match.
    The teams are displayed and  the opposition and your teams strengths and
    weaknesses are compared. If your fitness is significantly low the
    likelyhood of catches being dropped, fielder mistakes and a general
    lethargic performance overall are increased. Alterations should be made
    when you next return to the main menu. A coin is tossed and the opposition
    will inform you of its intention to bat or field if it wins, press space
    to continue. If you win use 'b' to bat or 'f' to field.

 iii) If you elect or are put into bat

    Select your two openers. They should be chosen to see off the new ball to
    enable the middle order to slog. Openers are specialist batsmen and by
    looking at player qualities when choosing the team you can see which
    normally do the job. Enter the batsman number and press 'return'.
    Edited Highlights will be displayed.... Make sure your finger is poised
    over The 'r' button. If the ball doesn't cross the boundary as a 4 or 6 it
    will be fielded by the opposition. By pressing 'r' will enable your batsmen
    to run, you must decide if it is safe to do so. Failure to keep the score-
    board ticking over by taking quick runs will reduce the overall team
    score. However, run outs can be equally disasterous. Even if you are
    outside the crease there is still a possibility that the opposition fielder
    will miss the stumps. If a decision is close the umpire will be called
    upon to adjudicate. Unfortunately this is open to human error and may be
    dubious but that's cricket! Along the bottom of the field brief comments
    on the action is displayed.

  iv) If you elect to field or are put into field

    Utilising your bowlers to the optinum performance is an acquired skill.
    With practise you will discover which can conserve runs and which will take
    wickets. When in the scorecard (ie at fall of Wicket or at the end of each
    over) by pressing 'f' you will be able to select from three fields -
    orthodox, defensive, attacking, highly attacking and unorthodox each with
    their own merits. The first 10 overs with the new ball and the last are
    the most critical. Bowlers are restricted to 10 overs none of which can be
    bowled consecutively. If you are unable to select a particular bowler
    or the computer automatically selects someone else this is to enable the
    above rules for bowling to apply. This can be remedied by trying another
    bowler who hasn't completed his spell.

    After your match has finished all the league results that week are shown.
    (including high scores and best bowling figures).

   v) Strategy

    Once you have got to grips with the game you may find that you want to have
    a greater influence on how you play each match. You can do this by using
    the strategy option which enables you to change the risk with which your
    team plays. For example, if you find that you need to increase your run
    rate try increasing the risk in the strategy page.

    The strategy option is available by pressing 'S' when:
    a) A bowler is running up to the wicket
    b) You are selecting a new batsman to go into bat
    c) You are bowling and an over has just been completed.

  vi) The Tournaments

    The CARIBBEAN LEAGUE - Four guest nations plus the West Indies battle it
    out on a round robbin basis in the heat of the Caribbean to see who will
    top the league.

    The CURREY CUP - Hosts South Africa and Zimbabwae challenge two other
    teams in a knockout event over 45 overs.

    The FOUNDERS CUP - A series of three matches which pits England against a
    guest nation over 50 overs. The winner being the team which wins the most
    games.  It is played in England.

    The PACIFIC CUP - A tough tournament which pits a guest nation against
    hosts Australia and New Zealand in a league over 40 overs. The top two
    then play off in the final to decide the winners.

    The SHAH CUP - This event features two mini leagues of three teams. Sri
    Lanka, Pakistan and India have home advantage against three guest nations.
    The top two teams of each league contest the semi finals and then the
    final.

    The WORLD CUP - This is the BIG tournament that all the teams have been
    preparing for. It begins with a league stage involving all 8 qualifying
    teams who play each other in a round robin format. The top 4 in the
    final league table then go through to the semi-finals of the knockout
    stage.

 vii) Other bits and pieces

    There is a round-up of all the tournaments at the end of every year. Each
    team plays three international one-day tournaments and the eight out of
    the nine with the best % wins qualify for the "World Cup". If you fail to
    qualify you are sacked!

    Your career averages and averages since the last World Cup are available
    after each tournament.


  8) Quiting the game during a match
  ----------------------------------
   You can exit World Cup Cricket in the middle of a match by pressing the
   function key F9.


  9) Changing the speed
  ---------------------
   The speed at which the game runs should be the same for both fast and slow
   PC's. However, if you wish to make the game faster or slower, you could try 
   typing the following (instead of just "WCC") when you next run World Cup
   Cricket:

	WCC X  (Where X is a whole number from 1 to 30000)

   The LOWER the number the FASTER the game will run.

   As a rough guide, a 286-12 machine should run perfectly using

	WCC 50		to begin the game.

   and a 486DX2-66 should run about right using

	WCC 500		to begin the game.

   You may have to play around with finding the best value for you.


 10) Changing the difficultly
 ----------------------------
   There are three ways to change the level of difficulty.

   Firstly, change the level setting - you probably guessed this one!

   Secondly, by changing which team you take charge of, you are affecting how
   easy or difficult winning will be.  For example, if you choose Zimbabwe, you
   will have a tough job on your hands!

   Thirdly, by changing the speed of the game (see above) running between
   wickets will be more or less difficult. Increasing the speed will probably
   result in more of your batsmen being run out, since judging when to go for
   that tight single is that much more difficult.  Try running World Cup
   Cricket by typing "WCC 1" (at the DOS prompt) on a Pentium PC!


 11) Information on changing player data
 ----------------------------------------
   If you decide that you want to change some of the names you can easily
   change the data files in the "Teams\" subdirectory, using a text editor.
   However, if you do this you must make sure that you have backed up this
   program in case anything goes wrong.

   I will try and implement a team editor in future releases.

   your registration form.


 14) Information for registered users
 ------------------------------------
   Registered users are entitled to free updates.  During September 1996 I
   introduced a new "key file" registration system. If you are not familiar
   with "key files" or are a registered user but do not have one then see below
   for more information.

   If you DO have a "key file" (called "WCC.key") then you can get updates by
   simply obtaining the latest shareware version (from my WWW homepage or a
   shareware provider).  Once you have got the shareware version (no earlier
   than version 2.50 for Sticky Wicket and 2.60 for World Cup Cricket) all you
   need to do is move the "key file" into the same directory.  The title page
   and main menu will tell you whether the game is running in "registered" mode
   or not.

   You can also obtain updates by post (snail mail).  Simply send me your
   original registered copy together with a stamped (first or second class is
   enough) addressed jiffy bag to me.  I will return your disk with the latest
   version and your "key file".


 15) Information on key files
 ----------------------------
   As of September 1996 (Sticky Wicket v2.50, World Cup Cricket v2.60) I
   introduced a new "key file" registration system. The idea is fairly simple:

   Suppose you register for the game World Cup Cricket.  I then send you the
   latest SHAREWARE version of World Cup Cricket plus your personalised
   registration "key file" called WCC.KEY (This is SW.KEY for Sticky Wicket).
   The presence of this "key file" unlocks the registered features of the game
   that were disabled in the shareware version.

   The main benefit of this is so that registered users only need to obtain the
   latest SHAREWARE version to update their registered version.  Simply ensure
   that the "key file" is in the same directory as the program file (ie SW.EXE
   or WCC.EXE).

   If you registered before September 1996 then you will probably not have a
   "key file".  You can obtain it by one of two ways:

	1. By E-Mail:
	   E-mail me your name and home (snail mail) address along with the
	   name of the game (SW or WCC or both) you registered for.  I will
	   "attach" your "key file" to my reply.

	2. By Post (Snail Mail):
	   Send me your original registered game disk and a stamped addressed
	   jiffy bag. I will put your "key file" on this disk along with the
	   latest version of the game.


 16) Sticky Wicket - another cricket game by Mark Carter
 -------------------------------------------------------
   Sticky Wicket is based on one-day matches in both league and cup
   competitions played between english county teams. This is one of the very
   few cricket games to combine strategy and statistics with interactive match
   action. Matches are shown through a birds-eye view of the field where ball
   movement, fielding and batsmen running can be followed. By careful team
   selections, choosing field placings, rotating bowlers, changing batting
   order and deciding when batsmen run, you aim to win the league and cup
   trophies.

   These are the features of the registered version:

   * Database of 288 players, 18 teams each with career statistics and batting
     and bowling abilities
   * 8 teams take part in any season
   * Possible to add extra teams (up to 36 in total) to the 18 already present
   * Seasonal and career averages
   * Unlimited number of seasons
   * Each season consists of the Sunday League and Sticky Cup competitions
   * Sunday League consists of seven 40-over matches including league table,
     fixture list and results service each week
   * 40 over Sticky Cup competition involving all 8 teams
   * Edited highlights of the game including action shots, LBWs, run outs etc
   * Match interactivity - when to run, who to bowl, batting order, field
     placings etc
   * Umpire decisions in response to appeals
   * Team selection - choose 11 from 16 before each match
   * 5 different built-in field settings
   * Save / restore facility - up to 8 different save positions
   * Career page showing your teams records and comparisons with other teams
   * 2-player matches between any 2 teams of your choice


 17) The brand new Sticky Wicket & World Cup Cricket WWW page!
 -------------------------------------------------------------
   I have just got myself 5 Mb of webspace and so decided that I must include a
   Sticky Wicket & World Cup Cricket homepage.  This contains all the
   information you need to know about the games including what the latest

 18) Definition of shareware
 ---------------------------
   Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying
   it. If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are required
   to register it.

   Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and retail software, and the
   copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as
   stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like
   retail authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases,
   there are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method
   of distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy and
   distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group.
   For example, some authors require written permission before a commercial
   disk vendor may copy their Shareware.

   Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You should find
   software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's retail or
   Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because you
   can try before you buy. And because the overhead is lower, prices are lower
   also. Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use
   the product, you don't pay for it.

   program may be altered by any means (this includes editing, reprogramming,
   crunching, resourceing etc.), except archiving.

   The author is in no way liable for any changes made to any part of the

 21) Distribution
 ----------------
   Profits may be made by distributing this piece of software - only a nominal
   fee may be charged to cover postage, packing, materials etc. All files,
   other than those with the .KEY extension, may be copied so long as they are
   copied in their entirety and are not seperated from each other. The files
   may be compressed into a .ZIP format (I recommend naming the zip file
   WCC260.ZIP) in which case the directory structure should be preserved. In
   fact, I actively encourage distributing the software, but under no
   circumstances may any files with the .KEY extension be copied or included in
   any archive etc.
